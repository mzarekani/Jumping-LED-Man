# Jumping-LED-Man
A LED Matrix Game where you jump or duck to avoid obstacles.
Requires an Arduino Uno or similar board, an 8x32 LED matrix, two buttons, and a breadborad. See schematic.jpg as well as the code(for the wire mapping) for help in setting the game up.
One button lets you jump, the other lets you duck. You have three lives. The obstacles become faster as you progress.
